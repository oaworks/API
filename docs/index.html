<p style="text-align: center; color: #999;">
  A "radically distributed, powerfully simple" API framework<br>
</p>

<div class="contents print"></div>

<hr></hr>

<p>An API is commonly thought of as something we use for remote requests -
but any function has a signature input and an output, and that's an API too.
So why is it that frameworks tend to make us do more work defining routes onto 
declared functions? Let's turn that around.</p>

<p>Paradigm is a minimalist node.js framework with an API-first approach, 
providing a wrapper for things like auth, caching, search, and more. 
So if you can write a function, you can create an API.</p>

<p>We use Paradigm to build and run the <a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works">OA.Works API</a>.</p>
<!--, 
which also serves as working examples for these docs.</p>-->

<h2 name="usingoaworks">Using OA.Works API</h2>

<p>OA.Works started as Open Access Button, and 
<a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/api">our old API</a> provides legacy functionality while we transition during 2021.
It's an API for accessing papers (through <a href="#find">Open Access</a>, <a href="#subscriptions">subscriptions</a>, 
<a href="#ill">Interlibrary Loans</a>, and <a href="#request">emails to authors</a>), <a href="#metadata">finding metadata</a>, 
and <a href="#deposit">depositing papers</a>.</p>

<p>Please limit your requests to two per second, and include an email address in a <b>User-Agent</b> header. 
Or if you've signed up for an account, include your API key in an <b>x-apikey</b> header. 
It helps us tell our funders how we're doing, and if we have to restrict high usage to keep the API stable for everyone then
we'd love to be able to contact you about increasing limits.</p>

<p>If you're looking to integrate OA.Works with your tools but aren't able to code, our 
<a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/libraries">tools for librarians</a>, 
especially <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/integrations">integration guides</a>, 
may be a better fit.</p>

<h3>/find</h3>

<p>Returns a URL to any Open Access paper, along with all the metadata we can find about it.</p>

<p>Accepts a DOI appended to the URL, or a parameter called <b>id</b>, which should contain (in order of preference) a URL-encoded DOI, PMC ID, PMID, url, title, or citation.</p>

<p><b>/metadata</b> is a convenient alternative that only returns the <b>metadata</b> section of the response.</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl -X GET '<a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works">https://api.oa.works</a>' -H 'User-Agent: youremail@yourdomain.com'
curl -X GET '<a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works/find?id=10.1126/science.196.4287.293">https://api.oa.works/find?id=10.1126/science.196.4287.293</a>' -H 'x-apikey: APIKEY'

</pre>

<h3>/permissions</h3>

<h4 class="m2">/permissions/:doi<br>
/permissions/:issn<br>
/permissions/:crossref-name<br>
/permissions/:ror</h4>

<p>Returns results specific to a particular paper, journal, or publisher, 
if present in our records. The response will include a calculated <b>best_permission</b> 
and a list of <b>all_permissions</b> so that you can also review yourself.</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl <a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works/permissions/10.1126/science.196.4287.293">https://api.oa.works/permissions/10.1126/science.196.4287.293</a>

curl <a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works/permissions/Public%20Library%20of%20Science">https://api.oa.works/permissions/Public Library of Science</a></code>
</pre>

<p>When providing a DOI, an <b>affiliation</b> URL parameter containing a <a target="_blank" href="https://ror.org">ROR ID</a> 
can optionally be added to include any relevant institutional policies in the response.</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl <a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works/permissions/10.1126/science.196.4287.293?affiliation=02tyrky19">https://api.oa.works/permissions/10.1126/science.196.4287.293?affiliation=02tyrky19</a></code>
</pre>

<h4>/permissions/:type</h4>

<p>Returns all policies of a particular <b>type</b> available in our records, for review. 
<b>Type</b> can be one of <b>journals</b>, <b>publishers</b>, or <b>affiliations</b>.</p>

<pre class="shadow">
curl <a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works/permissions/journals">https://api.oa.works/permissions/journals</a>
curl <a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works/permissions/journals">https://api.oa.works/permissions/publishers</a>
curl <a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works/permissions/journals">https://api.oa.works/permissions/affiliations</a></code>
</pre>

<p>The response is an Elasticsearch v7.10.0 search endpoint. Simple searches can be created by adding a search query in a <b>q</b> 
URL parameter. Check out the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/query-dsl.html">Elasticsearch docs</a> to learn more about search queries.</p>


<h3>/ill</h3>

<p>Starts an ILL request by returning a link to a completed ILL form or sending an email. 
This requires prior signup and configuration. Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://instantill.org">InstantILL</a>
for more information about signing up.</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl -X POST 'https://api.oa.works/ill/10.1234/567890'</code>
</pre>

<p>Provide an ID for a paper either as a DOI appended on the URL, or as URL parameters, or in a JSON body. Suitable IDs are the same 
as those for <a class="goto" href="#/find">/find</a>. If you have any additional metadata for the article, 
such as <b>title</b>, <b>journal</b>, etc, include those as parameters on the URL or in the JSON body. The metadata key 
names we typically use can be viewed in one of our <a class="goto" href="#/find">/metadata</a> responses. 
We'll add what we can to whatever metadata you give us.</p>

<p>We will then attempt to start an ILL according to your InstantILL configuration. By default, we will send an email to your account email, 
and you'll need to pass the requestor's email in an <b>email</b> URL parameter. If InstantILL is configured to do so, we can pass you a 
link to your completed ILL form.</p>


<h4>/ills</h4>

<p>Search ILLs made at your institution.</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl -X GET 'https://api.oa.works/ills' -H 'x-apikey: APIKEY'</code>
</pre>

<p>This is useful for developing your own custom integrations with <a target="_blank" href="https://instantill.org">InstantILL</a>. 
This route can be used to retrieve all activity from your embed(s) then you can process them as you wish.</p>

<p>The response is an Elasticsearch v7.10.0 search endpoint. Simple searches can be created by adding a search query in a <b>q</b> 
URL parameter. See the above for an example query, and view the response to see field names you can use to customise the query. 
Note, responses will not necessarily have all fields - it depends what we can find in each case. Check out the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/query-dsl.html">Elasticsearch docs</a> to learn more about search queries.</p>

<hr></hr>

<h2 name="usingparadigm">Using Paradigm API</h2>

<p>Paradigm API returns JSON by default, although many routes can also return an HTML
or CSV response for convenience, if <b>.html</b> or <b>.csv</b> are appended. Some 
endpoints may return HTML by default in which case appending <b>.json</b> may provide 
a JSON response.</p>

<p>We run a full copy of the API for you to try out. Please limit your requests to 
two per second and include an email address in a <b>User-Agent</b> header 
(or <a class="goto" href="#auth">sign up and use an API key</a>) in case we need to contact you.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="/status">/status</a> page lists available routes.
Some routes may only be visible or accessible with authorisation, so use your 
API key (or email and resume key) on your requests.</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl -X GET '<a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works">https://api.oa.works</a>' -H 'User-Agent: youremail@yourdomain.com'
curl '<a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works/status">https://api.oa.works/status</a>' -H 'x-apikey: ...'
curl '<a target="_blank" href="https://api.oa.works/status">https://api.oa.works/status?apikey=...</a>'</code>
</pre>



<h3 name="auth">Auth</h3>

<p><b>/auth</b> routes handle user and group management. Paradigm uses passwordless login, and 
all that is necessary to start an account is to provide a valid email address - you will 
receive a login token to type back into the login page, and then you're logged in. Repeat 
the process any time you need to get logged in again.</p>

<p>Signing in using the browser UI sets a cookie so 
further browser-based requests won't require another login or an API key. 
Custom signup/login pages should be made when developing your own service, but the 
API also gives a basic UI for it - just append <b>.html</b> to the <b>/auth</b> URL and you can sign in!</p>

<p><a href="/auth.html">Sign up at /auth.html</a></p>

<!--For this reason, the most useful client 
library provided with Paradigm is probably the login library; read more about the 
<a class="goto" href="#client">client libraries</a> to learn how to use it.</p>
-->

<p>To login directly via the API, start by requesting an auth token to be sent to your email 
address; once it arrives, send it back to the <b>/auth</b> endpoint:</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl 'https://api.oa.works/auth/token?email=...'
curl 'https://api.oa.works/auth?token=...'</code>
</pre>

<p>That's it, you're logged in, and can include <b>email</b> and <b>resume</b> 
parameters to subsequent requests - you'll find the <b>resume</b> value in the response object. 
You can logout at <a href="/auth/logout">/auth/logout</a> - if you did this via the browser 
it will include the cookie to log you out, otherwise remember to add the parameters.</p>


<h4>Roles</h4>

<p>Some endpoints will require you to have a particular <b>role</b> as well as being logged in. 
If you're logged in and still refused access, the refusal response will include a URL 
you can open to create a request to be assigned the role.</p>


<h3>Sources</h3>

<p><b>/src</b> routes are used to connect to some remote source that isn't part of Paradigm. As our main 
project goals over the years have been about academic research, most of these are for querying 
and caching useful remote datasets. For example we have a <b>/src</b> route to query and cache the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/">Crossref API</a>.</p>

<p>The point of these routes is to make it really easy to use Paradigm to integrate with other 
services. Instead of having to remember how to use some other API, or write a separate library 
to use them, one endpoint can be added to Paradigm to encapsulate that knowledge. It can then 
also benefit from the features of Paradigm, such as being cached, or loaded into Elasticsearch 
for powerful querying and analysis.</p>

<p>The status page lists available routes, including all the <b>/src</b> routes. Go 
directly to the main route of a <b>/src</b> to find more information about it.</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl <a target="_blank" href="/src/crossref">https://api.oa.works/src/crossref</a></code>
</pre>

<p>(These parts of documentation are still in progress - sorry if you don't find anything 
useful; looking at the code of a src and the notes surrounding it will have to suffice for now.)</p>

<!--
<p>Sources can be added for any API you'd like to integrate with - go to the 
<a class="goto" href="#development">Development</a> section for more information 
about extending Paradigm to suit your needs.</p>
-->


<h3>Services</h3>

<p><b>/svc</b> routes are for particular services that have been built using Paradigm. 
For example OA.Works is an API service that we've written with Paradigm, and we've 
deployed it with our main Paradigm API code, so you can find 
a <b>/svc/oaworks</b> route in our <a target="_blank" href="/status">status page</a> response.</p>

<p>Like OA.Works, a service can be written using Paradigm and then exposed as a
virtually standalone API. So documentation for individual services is left up to each 
service. Like <b>src</b> routes, the main route of a service should display useful 
information about it.</p>
<!--, and further documentation may be written separately as we have 
done above for OA.Works.</p>-->

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl <a target="_blank" href="/svc/oaworks">https://api.oa.works/svc/oaworks</a></code>
</pre>

<p>You may also notice that this is the same:</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl <a target="_blank" href="/">https://api.oa.works</a></code>
</pre>

<p>When you write your own service you usually want it to be the main 
route of the API, not a subroute, so there is an optional 
<a class="goto" href="#settings">setting</a> to bring your service up to the main 
route.</p>
<!--
See the <a class="goto" href="#development">Development</a> section for more information.</p>
-->


<h3>Search</h3>

<p>One of the most powerful features of Paradigm is easy integration with an Elasticsearch 
index for storing, searching, and analysing data. A data endpoint can be created with just 
one setting, which enables search and also automatically configures some additional endpoints:</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>curl '<a target="_blank" href='/svc/oaworks/permissions/publishers?q="public%20library%20of%20science"'>/permissions/publishers?q="public%20library%20of%20science"</a>'
curl '<a target="_blank" href="/svc/oaworks/permissions/publishers/keys">/permissions/publishers/keys</a>'
curl '<a target="_blank" href="/svc/oaworks/permissions/publishers/terms">/permissions/publishers/terms</a>'
curl '<a target="_blank" href="/svc/oaworks/permissions/publishers/suggest">/permissions/publishers/suggest</a>'
curl '<a target="_blank" href="/svc/oaworks/permissions/publishers/count">/permissions/publishers/count</a>'
curl '<a target="_blank" href="/svc/oaworks/permissions/publishers/min">/permissions/publishers/min</a>'
curl '<a target="_blank" href="/svc/oaworks/permissions/publishers/max">/permissions/publishers/max</a>'
curl '<a target="_blank" href="/svc/oaworks/permissions/publishers/range">/permissions/publishers/range</a>'
</code>
</pre>

<p>The full documentation for Elasticsearch queries is very good, so we recommend
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/query-dsl.html">
checking out their docs directly</a>.</p>

<!--However our built-in user interfaces make use of Elasticsearch queries, so 
read on to learn about them and see some examples of how queries can be used for 
very powerful results.</p>-->

<h3>Handling files</h3>

<p>Coming soon, details of our file handling API, integrating with local disk, Amazon s3, Cloudflare storage.</p>


<h3>Built-in UIs</h3>


<h3 name="client">Client libraries</h3>

<p>Paradigm is intentionally designed to place no constraints on what sort of user 
interface can be used with it - you could build a website, a mobile app, a widget - 
or all of those! We did experiment with integrated backend/frontend architectures 
and various UI frameworks from small ones like backbone or skeleton right up to 
things like React and Meteor. But none of them meet any of our specific requirements, 
and all of them introduce additional complexity. So, since we DO require to keep things 
as light as possible for access on the worst internet connections, we built a small 
set of useful but entirely optional javascript libraries that make it even easier 
to use the Paradigm API, and can be used alongside whatever other frontend frameworks 
you may want to implement yourself. As our built-in UIs described in the previous 
section demonstrates, it's possible to build quite a lot with not very much.</p>

<p>Note bg is optional, cloudflare workers / unbound may also be enough for some: https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-unbound-ga/</p>

<p>We use Cloudflare Workers however we don't want to be tied
to one provider, so Paradigm can run anywhere that node.js can run. 
Where we use particular Cloudflare infrastructure such as Workers KV, we also consider our 
fallback position such as writing to Elasticsearch if KV is not available, and planning that 
later we could easily update our key/value store code to use Redis instead.</p>

<!--
<p>If you want to know more about why we chose Cloudflare, and the other choices we made, 
read our <a class="goto" href="#development">Development</a> section.</p>
-->


<h3>Cloudflare worker</h3>

<p>To deploy your own cloudflare worker, first 
<a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com">sign up or login</a> to cloudflare. 
Everything you need for the demo and even to run a pretty powerful API is available 
in the free tier. Once signed up, copy your account ID and API token from the cloudflare dashboard main page. 
You'll find it displayed near the bottom right.</p>

<!--Optionally, go to the <b>Workers</b> tab and 
create a KV namespace, and note down the name you gave it (you can call it Paradigm).</p>
<p>(Workers KV is also available free on cloudflare. There are limits on free usage, but they're plenty to start with.)</p>-->

<p>Next, <a class="goto" href="#install">clone our git repo</a> (if you haven't already) and create a folder 
called <b>secrets</b> in the main Paradigm folder, and in there create a file called 
<b>construct.json</b>.</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>cd paradigm
mkdir secrets && touch secrets/construct.json
vim secrets/construct.json</code>
</pre>

<p>In that file, write a JSON object with the keys <b>ACCOUNT_ID</b>, <b>API_TOKEN</b>, 
and <b>SCRIPT_ID</b>. Use the values you copied from cloudflare for the first two, and the 
script ID can be whatever you want to call your worker. Once you've saved your construct file, 
run the constructor!</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>coffee construct.coffee</code>
</pre>

<p>Cloudflare provide a great tool called 
<a target="_blank" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler">wrangler</a> 
which can be used to deploy and configure your worker. We don't use wrangler because we want to remain 
independent of any one platform, but if you don't have such concerns, it may be worth 
looking into.</p>

<p>Now you should have your own Paradigm API up and running in a cloudflare worker! Note it won't 
be able to save anything yet though. So, continue on to read about Settings & 
Secrets, and Elasticsearch.</p>


<h3 name="settings">Settings & secrets</h3>

<p>The standard demo makes a few assumptions about the environment, and limits what 
can be done with it. The major limitation is that it does not know 
where Elasticsearch is so it can't save any data - so you'll want to configure some 
settings.</p>

<p>We differentiate between settings and secrets. Settings are anything that you want 
to be able to easily configure, and perhaps have different values for development vs 
production versions, where as secrets are settings like API keys for other services - 
you wouldn't want to share them in your repo or in a web browser.</p>

<p>We have the git repo configured to ignore any file in any folder called <b>secrets</b> 
anywhere in the repo. Create a <b>secrets</b> folder in the <b>worker</b> and <b>server</b> 
folders as well, and in those you can put settings/secrets relevant to each. So you can write 
any settings or secrets in the <b>secrets</b> folders you create. 
But you can also put settings in any file in the code, or create new files and put settings 
in them. We have one in our worker code called <b>settings.json</b>, for example, and it can 
be seen in the repo because it's not inside a secrets folder (and we don't put secrets in it).</p>

<p>There's also a hierarchy to the secrets and settings. At the top level there's 
the main secrets folder where you would have created your <b>construct</b> file - 
it's secret because your cloudflare API keys are in there. 
Nothing from that file gets included in the main code, it's only used by the constructor 
for deployments. Note, you can also provide a list of objects in that file if you want 
to deploy identical workers to different cloudflare accounts.</p>

<p>Anything set in the worker folder will be 
available in the worker and also in the server, if you do run and build your own server, 
because the server runs a local copy of the worker.</p>

<p>Any setting in the server folder will only be available if you run your own server, 
they won't be copied into a worker deployed to cloudflare.</p>

<p>The most useful secrets to put in your first settings file will be the ones that 
enable your API to save data so your API can save data - so read on about setting 
up Elasticsearch.</p>


<h3>Elasticsearch</h3>

<p>We use Elasticsearch 7.10.0, and we use the Amazon Open Distro version. You can 
use any version you like, as long as it's new enough to be compatible with 7.x index 
structures. We run our own cluster on <a href="https://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a>, 
but you can use any provider you prefer, or even run it locally on your own machine to 
try out.</p>

<p>There are providers who will run Elasticsearch for you. We've found them 
all to be pretty expensive for production scaling, so it's cheaper for us to run our own. 
If you're just getting started and aren't comfortable with sysadmin, 
<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&all-free-tier.q=elasticsearch&all-free-tier.q_operator=AND">
Amazon Web Services provide a small free tier</a> that is probably the easiest way to 
run a cluster, and you can just 
<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/pricing/">pay to scale it up</a>
later if you want.</p>

<p>Once you sign up and start an Elasticsearch service, you'll get a URL to your own cluster, and probably a 
<b>username:password</b> combination. Put those in your <b>worker/secrets/settings.json</b> like so:</p>

<pre class="shadow">
<code>{
  "index": {
    "url": "https://username:password@your.index.com" # A URL to your elasticsearch
  }
}</code>
</pre>

<p>Installing Elasticsearch to try out is pretty easy on Linux, we're not sure about Apple 
or Windows though - their documentation does explain how, but we've never tried it. Managing 
a large production cluster can get complicated, but it does give you more power and control 
in comparison to paying a service provider for it. Also, whilst Elasticsearch itself is free 
and open source, and you can run it on your own laptop to start with, you'll need to pay for 
a machine or cluster of machines to run it in production, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Rather than us writing more instructions that will get out of date, it's best to go straight to the source -

<!--  "kv": "your_kv" # Optional cloudflare KV namespace for your worker to use
<p>A simpler data storage solution that just stores and retrieves records is 
Cloudflare KV. It has very limited search capability, but may be useful, cheaper, 
faster for basic storage. If you create a KV namespace in Cloudflare, insert 
the namespace you created for your worker in the <b>kv</b> setting key shown above. 
Otherwise, remove the <b>kv</b> key from your settings file.</p>

<h3>Scheduled tasks</h3>

<p>Use CF workers tasks. In the code _schedule can be specified on tasks that need it (link to the code docs).</p>

<p>Just set one CF workers task to run every minute, it will poll the worker and trigger the schedules.</p>

<p>For long term non-vendor-lock-in concerns, we have already considered Redis and know how we would use it 
to replace CF workers task schedules. It could even be done with a simple cron job, or a monitor service like 
uptimerobot hitting a certain URL, so not a big deal. For peace of mind, just making it clear this isn't a 
deal-breaker for anyone worried about vendor lock-in.</p>

<h3>Sysadmin considerations</h3>

<p>Logs, monitors, alerts</p>

Built-in logging

Uptimerobot, Updown, Ghost inspector, Kibana (which has alerts and scheduling too), pm2, Digital Ocean alerts, etc

<h2 name="development">Development</h2>

<p>Our projects are about exploring a problem (such as increasing access to publicly 
funded research) rather than building apps. Specificity in app development tends to 
happen at the UI level (OA.Works offers ShareYourPaper, InstantILL, etc) with a strong 
focus on user experience and ease of use. So our approach to development is to have a core 
set of abilities readily deployed - like being able to load and analyse large datasets, 
cache our own results and remote requests, sync with smaller sources managed by administrators 
(such as from CSVs or Google sheets).</p>

<p>Over the years, with changing funding priorities, we had to present powerful prototypes 
quickly with zero budget, yet still benefit long term from the effort that went into them, 
so we always try to generalise solutions. Separate teams had to be able to build simple static 
sites, widgets, plugins etc that could make use of our powerful API functionality, and we often 
deploy embeds for use on websites beyond our control. Our users are spread around the world with 
varying levels of internet access, so we need to keep things small with minimal dependencies.</p>

<p>API development is often not seen as high priority from a project or funding perspective, 
because it's not very visible to normal users until there is a UI they can understand. So 
we also generalised some UI prototyping into our API, along with some handy (but optional) 
javascript client libraries.</p>

<p>Now that we have more time and funding available, we are doing more to document and share 
our API work as a standalone project deliverable. It's gone through four major versions 
already, and now we're releasing version five as the Paradigm API framework, with OA.Works 
as the exemplar service built with it.</p>

<p>Once we solve one problem we want to move on to new ones. But if our project ends, 
or our preferred platform/service/commercial provider goes bust, we want our work to 
remain useful for others. And we use many open source tools ourselves, building on what 
others did before us. So of course, Paradigm is open source as well.</p>

<h3>Principles</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Build powerfully simple solutions where they don't already exist.</li>
  <li>Make use of existing things that provide features worth the size/complexity/dependency they introduce (don't get locked in).</li>
  <li>Aim for fast 100% global uptime with graceful degradation, easily deployed with minimal sysadmin (radically distributed).</li>
  <hr class="small">
  <li>Processing should only happen when there's no suitable cache.</li>
  <li>Cache process results, and cascade caches, wherever possible.</li>
  <li>Logs are just a cache of requests and responses.</li>
  <li>Tests are just diffs of results vs logs.</li>
  <li>Data is just a cache that lasts a long time.</li>
  <li>Backups are just data that can't be (or that would be too time/resource intensive to be) regenerated.</li>
  <hr class="small">
  <li>Avoid relational complexity - if it looks like a document (API responses often do), treat it like a document.</li>
  <li>Eventual consistency is good enough except when it's not, so deal with those cases explicitly.</li>
  <li>If things are getting complicated, GOTO 1.</li>
</ol>

Why cloudflare? Radical deployment - cloudflare workers by default
it may be necessary to deploy without using cloudflare. We will always need at 
least one backend server anyway to handle co-ordination and long term storage / 
backup management, and certain processes that have to appear to run from one place such as Proxies.

* NOTE: We prefer Cloudflare to services such as Docker or Heroku because cloudflare 
are offering workers as secondary to the USP of cloudflare (which is network caching). 
So workers are free / extremely cheap. Also, we never really had much to gain from 
Docker or Heroku sorts of service because we could already do deployments to 
clusters of Linux machines easily because we had the skills, and it was much cheaper. 

Digital Ocean provides snapshots which are just as useful as Docker for our use case. 
But with cloudflare workers we could gain the benefit of reducing dependence on our 
cluster for no extra cost, and also if we built it in such a way to be able to 
optionally run on a normal server OR run on cloudflare workers, we can increase 
robustness whilst decreasing deployment complexity. It also adds even better 
performance gains to the main reason for using cloudflare, because it allows us 
greater control of what cloudflare caches under different circumstances.

Why elasticsearch / Amazon Elastic?

NOTE: Questions: Why aren't there any prototypes/classes used? Answer to be expanded upon: What would the actual benefit be?
It's not that we don't know about these, and OOP approach in general, but why use something that there is not a specific 
purpose for, particularly when there ARE benefits to doing it a different way? Those being easier wrapping and less 
effort to configure new additions to the code. But of course - DO use prototypes/classes when adding new functionality 
that WOULD benefit from them. This was most obvious when writing the Index functions, and directly relates to the old code 
where these WERE prototyped and then instantiated with "new ..."

<h4>Document orientation</h4>

<h4>Eventual consistency</h4>

<h4>No tests! Just diffs!</h4>

<p>Why difftest... why not normal tests</p>


<h3>Code structure</h3>

<p>Code is split into <b>worker</b> and <b>server</b>. Worker is where the vast bulk of code is, and where 
any future code would most likely go. Server is only for code that can only run on a background server. Everything 
in worker gets compiled into the server code as well. It's possible to write worker code that also only runs in a 
background context as there is a _bg wrapper option too. So what would go in server? A good example is what we have 
in our <b>src</b> endpoints, where in the server folder we have defined functions that bulk load millions of records 
into an index - there would never be any advantage running this in a worker context, so we write it straight into 
the server folder instead.</p>

<p>Worker code is deployed as a Cloudflare worker, although this is optional - it is also possible to deploy the server 
bundle anywhere that any Node.js app can be run, and to run clusters for scalability. So you could run your own copy 
anywhere you like.</p>

<p>The code itself is in the <b>src</b> directories found in worker and server. Both have an <b>api.coffee</b> file 
that is their main controller - the worker one handles integration with Cloudflare workers environment, whereas 
the server one runs the code as a typical Node.js server app available on localhost.</p>

<p>When the top level <b>construct.coffee</b> is run, it generates minified js worker and server files in their 
respective <b>dist</b> folders - these should not be edited directly. The worker dist file is then deployed to 
Cloudflare (if configured) and the server dist file can be used to run locally.</p>

<p>In the <b>worker/src</b> directory there are <b>data</b>, <b>src</b> and <b>svc</b> subdirectories. Data 
contains the cloudflare cache, cloudflare KV, and Elasticsearch controllers. Src is where we put controllers 
that connect to remote services run by other organisations. Svc is where we put our own services that we develop 
to use within the Paradigm framework (there's an <b>oaworks</b> directory in there, for example). Worker/src 
also contains some other files that provide the default API functions, described later.</p>

<p>Every function of Paradigm is defined as a value on the global object <b>P</b>. Whenever the worker API 
controller runs (which is also called by the server API controller) it provides a new instance of P to process 
the incoming request. So any function declared on P automatically becomes an API endpoint, available at a URL named 
after the dot notation key of the function.</p>

<p>For example in <b>worker/src/example.coffee</b> there is a declaration for <b>P.example.deep.deeper</b>. 
So the result of that function can be retrieved at <a href="/example/deep/deeper">/example/deep/deeper</a>.</p>


<h3>Wrapper config</h3>

<p><b>_auth</b> - if true an authorised user is required. If a string or a list, an authorised user with that role
(or one of the listed roles) is required. An empty list can be used to indicate that a user with a role 
equivalent to the route or a subset of the route is required.</p>

<p><b>_cache</b> - defaults to ... Otherwise can be set to false or a number indicating how many seconds the cache is 
valid for. (Passing refresh param on an incoming request wil override a cache.)</p>

<p>Note _auth and _cache are ALWAYS and ONLY checked first at the incoming request level.</p>

<p><b>_kv</b> - if true store the result in the key/value store, and check for it on new requests. Cloudflare KV is global with 1s eventual consistency - whereas Cloudflare cache is regional.</p>
<p><b>_index</b> - if true send the result to an index. It can be an object of index initialisation settings, mappings, aliases.</p>
<p><b>_key</b> - optionally specify which key name in a result object to lookup for a suitable ID value for the result.</p>
<p><b>_sheet</b> - if true get a sheet ID from settings for the given route. Or it can directly be the sheet ID string. If present it implies _index:true.</p>

<p><b>_async</b> - if true, don't wait for the result, just return _async:@rid. Subsequent requests can provide the @rid in a param called _async to check progress.</p>

<p><b>_bg</b> - if true run the function on the background server. Note this can happen at the top level request route or if that route calls any _bg function.</p>

<p><b>_history</b> - if true and new data was sent, store the POST content with the log rather than just whether or not there was any, so prior state can be inferred.</p>

<p><b>_diff</b> - if  true or a list of arguments for the function, it will check to see if a process gives the same result 
(compared against a previously logged identical request). If the result is different the log will record it, and subsequent 
log checking or alerting can be used to find unexpected differences.</p>

<p><b>_hide</b> - if true a function will not show up on the list of available routes - but it <b>IS</b> still accessible.
(If necessary a function can be written on the API object and yet be hidden AND inaccessible via a route, by prefixing the 
function name with an underscore.)</p>

<h3>Build your own service</h3>

<p>Write your own service standalone, and talk to ours over the API where necessary.</p>

<p>Fork paradigm, write your own service, deploy it - like we do for OA.Works.</p>

<p>Fork and run your own paradigm, AND write your own service, and deploy that separately.</p>

<p>If you have a specific service 
that you'd like to use the framework for, you're probably best to write your 
service separately then just include it in your own instance of Paradigm. We 
could host relevant services, so contact us if you need that.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute directly to the core of Paradigm, have a look at our github repo. 
The process is usually fork, change, request a merge. Long term contributors 
will be given access to develop feature branches and request PRs directly on our repo.</p>

<p>See the code repo and explore the issues, tags, project board etc.</p>

<p>Also our other relevant projects, UI repo, and so on.</p>

<p>Suggest stuff you need / would like to see added.</p>
