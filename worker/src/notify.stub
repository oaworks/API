# a user should be able to set a list of endpoints they want to receive notifications for
# could also wildcard* match
# note if there are lots of notifications, may need to group them
# user won't need auth for the endpoint because it won't give any info about the result - just that it happened?
# or if results are wanted, auth for the endpoint would be necessary
# notifications from this will go to a google chat bot webhook
# notifications will be triggered by log analysis, a scheduled job will need to check through them
